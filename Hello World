Lines beginning with a hash sign (#) are directives read and interpreted by what is known as the preprocessor. 
They are special lines interpreted before the compilation of the program itself begins.  
In this case, the directive #include <iostream>, instructs the preprocessor to include a section of standard C++ code, known as header iostream, that allows to perform standard input and output operations 
Such as writing the output of this program (Hello World) to the screen

This line initiates the declaration of a function. Essentially, a function is a group of code statements which are given a name: in this case, this gives the name "main" to the group of code statements that follow. 
Functions will be discussed in detail in a later chapter, but essentially, their definition is introduced with a succession of a type (int), a name (main) and a pair of parentheses (()), optionally including parameters. 
The function named main is a special function in all C++ programs; it is the function called when the program is run.  
The execution of all C++ programs begins with the main function, regardless of where the function is actually located within the code.
